## 1. Clean Architecture Refinement

Strengthen the separation of concerns to ensure the Application Core (Domain + Application) is independent, testable, and maintainable.

### Clean Architecture Todo Items

- [x] **Audit Current Dependencies:** Review all project references and ensure Application Core has no dependencies on Infrastructure or WebApi. Move any violations (e.g., direct EF usage in services).
- [x] **Define Interfaces in Application Core:** Move or create interfaces like `IUserRepository`, `ITodoItemRepository` in the Application layer if not already there. Ensure all services depend on abstractions.
- [x] **Implement Dependency Inversion:** Update service constructors to inject interfaces. Configure DI in `Program.cs` to wire implementations from Infrastructure.
- [ ] **Extract Domain Services:** Identify business logic in Application services and move pure domain rules to Domain Services (e.g., task assignment rules).
- [ ] **Refactor DTOs and Mappers:** Ensure AutoMapper profiles are complete and DTOs are in Application. Add validation attributes to DTOs.
- [ ] **Add Domain Events:** Implement basic event publishing (e.g., `TaskCompletedEvent`) using MediatR for decoupling.
- [ ] **Update Tests:** Modify unit tests to mock interfaces properly and ensure Application Core tests run in isolation.

## 2. API Design and Best Practices

Enhance the RESTful API for better usability, security, and performance.

### API Design Todo Items

- [x] **Implement API Versioning:** Add Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning package and configure versioning via URL paths (e.g., `/api/v1/todos`).
- [ ] **Add Rate Limiting:** Install AspNetCoreRateLimit and configure policies (e.g., 100 requests per minute per IP).
- [ ] **Implement HATEOAS:** Modify DTOs to include `_links` (e.g., self, related resources) using a library like HAL.
- [ ] **Standardize Error Handling:** Create a global exception filter returning ProblemDetails. Update all controllers to use consistent error responses.
- [ ] **Add Content Negotiation:** Support JSON and XML formats. Enable pagination for list endpoints with query parameters.
- [ ] **Secure Endpoints:** Fully implement JWT authentication (extend existing code). Add role-based authorization attributes (e.g., `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]`).
- [ ] **Enforce HTTPS:** Configure middleware to redirect HTTP to HTTPS and add HSTS headers.
- [ ] **Add API Documentation:** Integrate Swashbuckle.AspNetCore for OpenAPI/Swagger UI.
- [ ] **Implement Caching:** Add response caching for GET endpoints using `[ResponseCache]` or IDistributedCache.
- [ ] **Add Request Validation:** Use FluentValidation for complex DTO validations beyond data annotations.

## 3. Testing and Code Coverage Enhancement

Expand testing to cover more scenarios and achieve higher reliability.

### Testing Todo Items

- [ ] **Add Integration Tests for Repositories:** Create tests for `UserRepository`, `CommentRepository`, etc., using an in-memory or test database (e.g., Testcontainers for SQL Server).
- [ ] **Expand E2E Tests:** Add full workflow tests (e.g., user registration → task creation → comment addition → tag assignment).
- [ ] **Implement BDD with SpecFlow:** Install SpecFlow and write feature files for user stories (e.g., "As a user, I can assign a task").
- [ ] **Add Performance Tests:** Use NBomber to simulate load (e.g., 100 concurrent users creating tasks).
- [ ] **Increase Controller Coverage:** Add unit tests for all controller actions, mocking services.
- [ ] **Test Infrastructure Components:** Add tests for authorization, logging, and external services (e.g., Azure AI).
- [ ] **Automate Coverage Reporting:** Integrate coverage into CI/CD pipeline and set a target of 90%+ coverage.
- [ ] **Add Mutation Testing:** Use Stryker.NET to ensure tests are robust against code changes.

## 4. Advanced Features and Scalability

Add features to handle growth and improve user experience.

### Advanced Features Todo Items

- [ ] **Implement Real-Time Updates:** Add SignalR for live notifications (e.g., task updates broadcast to connected clients).
- [ ] **Add Caching Layer:** Integrate Redis for caching frequent queries (e.g., user lists, task summaries).
- [ ] **Introduce CQRS:** Separate read/write models using MediatR. Create query handlers for optimized reads.
- [ ] **Implement Event Sourcing:** Add event store (e.g., using Marten) for audit trails and undo functionality.
- [ ] **Enhance Search:** Add full-text search with Elasticsearch or EF Core's Contains for tasks/comments.
- [ ] **Containerization Improvements:** Update Docker Compose for multi-container (API + DB + Redis). Add health checks.
- [ ] **Horizontal Scaling Prep:** Configure Azure App Service scaling rules. Add load balancing considerations.
- [ ] **Add Background Jobs:** Use Hangfire for scheduled tasks (e.g., overdue task notifications).
- [ ] **Implement File Uploads:** Add support for attachments on tasks using Azure Blob Storage.

## 5. Framework and Tooling Improvements

Modernize tooling for better development and deployment.

### Tooling Todo Items

- [ ] **Upgrade Dependencies:** Update all NuGet packages to latest stable versions compatible with .NET 9.
- [ ] **Add Health Checks:** Implement `/health` endpoint with database and external service checks.
- [ ] **Enhance Logging:** Integrate Serilog with structured logging and sinks (e.g., Application Insights).
- [ ] **Optimize AutoMapper:** Review and optimize profiles for performance. Consider Mapster as an alternative.
- [ ] **Add Minimal APIs:** Refactor simple endpoints to use ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs for reduced boilerplate.
- [ ] **Implement Observability:** Add metrics with OpenTelemetry and tracing for performance monitoring.
- [ ] **CI/CD Enhancements:** Update GitHub Actions for automated testing, coverage reporting, and deployment to Azure.
- [ ] **Add Code Analysis:** Enable Roslyn analyzers and StyleCop for code quality checks.
- [ ] **Database Migrations:** Ensure EF migrations are versioned and reversible. Add seed data scripts.
