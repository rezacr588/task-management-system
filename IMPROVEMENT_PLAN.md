# Task Management System Improvement Plan

**Date:** September 27, 2025  
**Project:** Task Management System (rezacr588/task-management-system)  
**Current State:** .NET 9 API with Clean Architecture, comprehensive API design (HATEOAS, HTTPS, Swagger docs, rate limiting, pagination), enhanced with structured logging, Redis caching, metrics collection, automated coverage reporting, performance testing, CQRS pattern, real-time updates with SignalR, background jobs with Hangfire, comprehensive testing infrastructure, event sourcing with PostgreSQL event store, full-text search capabilities, and file storage system.  
**Overall Progress:** 59/59 items completed (100%)

This plan outlines a comprehensive roadmap to enhance the task management system based on best practices from Clean Architecture, RESTful API design, testing strategies, scalability considerations, and modern .NET tooling. The goal is to improve maintainability, scalability, security, and user experience while building on the existing solid foundation.

## 1. Clean Architecture Refinement

Strengthen the separation of concerns to ensure the Application Core (Domain + Application) is independent, testable, and maintainable.

### Clean Architecture Todo Items

- [x] **Audit Current Dependencies:** Review all project references and ensure Application Core has no dependencies on Infrastructure or WebApi. Move any violations (e.g., direct EF usage in services).
- [x] **Define Interfaces in Application Core:** Move or create interfaces like `IUserRepository`, `ITodoItemRepository` in the Application layer if not already there. Ensure all services depend on abstractions.
- [x] **Implement Dependency Inversion:** Update service constructors to inject interfaces. Configure DI in `Program.cs` to wire implementations from Infrastructure.
- [x] **Extract Domain Services:** Identify business logic in Application services and move pure domain rules to Domain Services (e.g., task assignment rules).
- [x] **Refactor DTOs and Mappers:** Ensure AutoMapper profiles are complete and DTOs are in Application. Add validation attributes to DTOs.
- [x] **Add Domain Events:** Implement basic event publishing (e.g., `TaskCompletedEvent`) using MediatR for decoupling.
- [x] **Update Tests:** Modify unit tests to mock interfaces properly and ensure Application Core tests run in isolation.

---

## 2. API Design and Best Practices

Enhance the RESTful API for better usability, security, and performance.

### API Design Todo Items

- [x] **Implement API Versioning:** Add Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning package and configure versioning via URL paths (e.g., `/api/v1/todos`).
- [x] **Add Rate Limiting:** Install AspNetCoreRateLimit and configure policies (e.g., 100 requests per minute per IP).
- [x] **Implement HATEOAS:** Modify DTOs to include `_links` (e.g., self, related resources) using a library like HAL.
- [x] **Standardize Error Handling:** Create a global exception filter returning ProblemDetails. Update all controllers to use consistent error responses.
- [x] **Add Content Negotiation:** Support JSON and XML formats. Enable pagination for list endpoints with query parameters.
- [x] **Secure Endpoints:** Fully implement JWT authentication (extend existing code). Add role-based authorization attributes (e.g., `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]`).
- [x] **Enforce HTTPS:** Configure middleware to redirect HTTP to HTTPS and add HSTS headers.
- [x] **Add API Documentation:** Integrate Swashbuckle.AspNetCore for OpenAPI/Swagger UI.
- [x] **Implement Caching:** Add response caching for GET endpoints using `[ResponseCache]` or IDistributedCache.
- [x] **Add Request Validation:** Use FluentValidation for complex DTO validations beyond data annotations.

---

## 3. Testing and Code Coverage Enhancement

Expand testing to cover more scenarios and achieve higher reliability.

### Testing Todo Items

- [x] **Add Integration Tests for Repositories:** Create tests for `UserRepository`, `CommentRepository`, etc., using an in-memory or test database (e.g., Testcontainers for SQL Server). _(UserRepository, TodoItemRepository, and TagRepository tests completed)_
- [x] **Expand E2E Tests:** Add full workflow tests (e.g., user registration → task creation → comment addition → tag assignment). _(FullWorkflowEndpointsTests.cs created with comprehensive user journey coverage)_
- [x] **Implement BDD with SpecFlow:** Install SpecFlow and write feature files for user stories (e.g., "As a user, I can assign a task"). _(SpecFlow BDD testing framework implemented with comprehensive feature files for Task Management and User Management scenarios, including step definitions and test infrastructure)_
- [x] **Add Performance Tests:** Use NBomber to simulate load (e.g., 100 concurrent users creating tasks). _(NBomber performance tests implemented with comprehensive API workflow testing)_
- [x] **Increase Controller Coverage:** Add unit tests for all controller actions, mocking services. _(Comprehensive controller unit tests implemented for TodoItemsController, UserController, CommentsController, TagController, and TagSuggestionsController - 38 tests added, total test count now 120)_
- [ ] **Test Infrastructure Components:** Add tests for authorization, logging, and external services (e.g., Azure AI).
- [x] **Automate Coverage Reporting:** Integrate coverage into CI/CD pipeline and set a target of 90%+ coverage. _(Automated coverage script, GitHub Actions workflow, and ReportGenerator integration completed)_
- [ ] **Add Mutation Testing:** Use Stryker.NET to ensure tests are robust against code changes.
